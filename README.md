# MongoDB basics
An introduction to MongoDB, its core components, and how it structures data using documents and collections.

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that uses a **document-oriented** data model. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it well-suited for modern web and mobile applications with evolving data requirements.

Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn't rely on tables and rows; instead, it uses **collections of documents**, offering greater flexibility and scalability.

## Documents and Collections

### Documents

Documents are the basic units of data in MongoDB. Each document is a **JSON-like** (BSON) object that stores data as key-value pairs. A document can include:

- Strings, numbers, booleans
- Arrays
- Embedded/nested documents
- Dates and more

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "skills": ["Python", "MongoDB"],
  "address": {
    "city": "Bristol",
    "postcode": "BS1 4DJ"
  }
}
```

Documents within the same collection can have different structures, making MongoDB very flexible.


### Collections

A **collection** is a group of related documents â€” similar to a table in a relational database, but without enforced structure. Collections organise documents within a MongoDB database and allow for efficient querying.

Key characteristics:
- Collections store multiple documents
- Documents within a collection can have different fields and data types
- No need to define a schema before inserting data

For example, a `users` collection might contain all user profile documents in an application:


```json
[
  {
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  },
  {
    "username": "bob42",
    "joined": "2023-07-01",
    "isActive": true
  }
]
```
