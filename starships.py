# Exercise:

# The data in this database (starwars) has been pulled from SWAPI Reborn - Star Wars APIs & Explorer.
# Note: The old api is no longer supported, there may be some differences between the data we have been working with
# and the data in this api.

# As well as 'people', the API has data on starships. In Python, pull data on all available starships from the API.
# The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship.

# Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships
# into their own collection. Use functions at the very least! OOP preferred.
